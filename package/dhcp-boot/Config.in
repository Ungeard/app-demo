	  Demo of how to create a container application that serves the
	  WeOS host system with a startup-config at system bootstrap.

	  The container runs dnsmasq to hand out a DHCP lease with a
	  boot file and TFTP server to the host system.  See the README
	  for more information and how to configure the WeOS host.
